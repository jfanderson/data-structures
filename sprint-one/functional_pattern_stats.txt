The data above illustrates that prototypal is the optimal choice when time is the utmost consideration, and either functional-shared or pseudoclassical are best for memory concerns. Despite its good memory usage, functional-shared is very slow in comparison to the other patterns. Our final recommendation would be pseudoclassical, for it is nearly best in memory usage, and also a close second in timing.
